                                        My primary research interest is investigating AI in systems security because I strongly feel that AI is a promising problem solver that can obtain satisfying solutions for complex problems. Indeed, the main area of my research is at the intersection of machine learning and systems security by concentrating on intrusion & malware detection.
                                        <br />
                                        <br />
                                        My current research focus is adversarial machine learning in the area of malware detection, which I am working on under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://www.veelasha.org/" target="_blank">Veelasha Moonsamy</a> and Dr. <a href="https://www.cs.ru.nl/~erikpoll/" target="_blank">Erik Poll</a>.

                                        Previously, I was a Research Assistant at Islamic Azad University (IAU), South Tehran Branch who was working on AI, particularly scalable machine learning. My considerable background in AI began on my master's project while I was trying to present an AI-based intrusion detection system for IoT that could detect various security threats.
										During this time, I have succeeded to present several novelties in machine learning, IoT security, and feature selection that brought various honors and awards for me.
										<br/>
										<br/>
										From September 2012 till September 2020, I was working in the National Organization of Educational Testing, Tehran, Iran as a Full-Stack Developer. It was a useful industrial career that made me an experienced software developer.
										<br/>
										<br/>
										I received my BSc and MSc degrees in Computer Engineering from IAU, Shiraz and South Tehran Branches, Iran in 2008 and 2015, respectively.

                                                    Over the past decade, the digital life of most people has moved from stationary devices such as desktop computers to computationally powerful mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablets or smartwatches. Not only do these devices bring a new level of convenience for users, they are also much more vulnerable to attacks that compromise the confidentiality of users' private data - as revealed by whistleblower Edward Snowden's global surveillance disclosures.

                                                    One might think that similar attacks existed before, but mobile smart devices over many new attack vectors that are not known
                                                    from stationary desktop PCs. For example, a new class of attack vector results from the plethora of sensors these devices
                                                    carry, such as GPS and motion sensors. While some of these attacks can be thwarted by sensible use of
                                                    strong cryptography - for instance, there now exist secure text-messenger apps that allow users to encrypt their
                                                    communication - strong cryptography alone is not able to protect against attacks that exploit side channels.
                                                    Side channels allow the exploitation of information emanating from the physical device, such as
                                                    electromagnetic radiation and power consumption. We are investigating the different classes of
                                                    attacks on smart mobile devices through the analysis of hardware and software requirements and design
                                                    countermeasures using novel and creative ideas by studying the problem from different angles. Our findings will then
                                                    be applied to other problem areas such as the Internet of Things. I am working on this project as PhD Candidate in the <a href="https://www.ru.nl/dis/" target="_blank">Digital Security group</a>, Radboud University.

                                                    Over the past decades, machine learning as the most efficient tool for pattern recognition has been the subject of
                                                    many studies. Optimum-path forest (OPF) is an outstanding graph-based
                                                    machine learning method that reduces the pattern recognition problems into the partitioning of
                                                    the graphs derived from the input data sets. OPF as a natural multi-classifier is a fast,
                                                    simple, and parameter-independent machine that supports partial overlapping among the classes.
                                                    Howover, this machine is an effective machine learning algorithm just for a
                                                    reasonable size of the input data sets. It seems that keeping a small sketch (or synopsis) of
                                                    some data that contains an approximation of the original data can be a proper solution for the
                                                    high computational complexity of OPF over the massive data sets. Coreset is a special data summarization
                                                    method that can be used for holding the small sketch of massive data sets. Therefore, to cope with high
                                                    computational complexity of OPF over massive data sets, this project tries to use the idea of
                                                    coreset in the context of OPF to provide a scalable OPF. This work is supported in part by <a href="http://insf.org/en" target="_blank">Iran National Science Foundation</a> grant No. 96010151.

                                                    The Internet of Things (IoT) is a worldwide network including all identifiable heterogeneous objects around us
                                                    such as smartphones, laptops or smart sensors that can connect to the Internet by using a wide range of
                                                    technologies. IoT is able to provide accessibility to the Internet for all physical objects since it is a
                                                    hybrid network of the Internet and diverse networks with heterogeneous nodes. Generally, due to the insecure
                                                    nature of the Internet as well as Wireless Sensor Networks, which are the main components of IoT, implementing
                                                    security mechanisms in IoT seems necessary. To deal with intrusions that may occur in IoT, a novel multi-faceted
                                                    intrusion detection system is proposed in this thesis which can detect both cyber-attacks and insider-attacks

													Adversarial Training (AT) has been widely applied to harden learning-based classifiers against adversarial evasive attacks. However, its effectiveness in identifying and strengthening vulnerable areas of the model's decision space while maintaining high performance on clean data of malware classifiers remains an under-explored area. In this context, the robustness that AT achieves has often been assessed against unrealistic or weak adversarial attacks, which negatively affect performance on clean data and are arguably no longer threats. Previous work seems to suggest robustness is a task-dependent property of AT. We instead argue it is a more complex problem that requires exploring AT and the intertwined roles played by certain factors within data, feature representations, classifiers, and robust optimization settings, as well as proper evaluation factors, such as the realism of evasion attacks, to gain a true sense of AT's effectiveness. In our paper, we address this gap by systematically exploring the role such factors have in hardening malware classifiers through AT. Contrary to recent prior work, a key observation of our research and extensive experiments confirm the hypotheses that all such factors influence the actual effectiveness of AT, as demonstrated by the varying degrees of success from our empirical analysis. We identify five evaluation pitfalls that affect state-of-the-art studies and summarize our insights in ten takeaways to draw promising research directions toward better understanding the factors' settings under which adversarial training works at best.

													Machine Learning (ML) promises to enhance the efficacy of Android Malware Detection (AMD); however, ML models are vulnerable to realistic evasion attacks--crafting realizable Adversarial Examples (AEs) that satisfy Android malware domain constraints. To eliminate ML vulnerabilities, defenders aim to identify susceptible regions in the feature space where ML models are prone to deception. The primary approach to identifying vulnerable regions involves investigating realizable AEs, but generating these feasible apps poses a challenge. For instance, previous work has relied on generating either feature-space norm-bounded AEs or problem-space realizable AEs in adversarial hardening. The former is efficient but lacks full coverage of vulnerable regions while the latter can uncover these regions by satisfying domain constraints but is known to be time-consuming. To address these limitations, we propose an approach to facilitate the identification of vulnerable regions. Specifically, we introduce a new interpretation of Android domain constraints in the feature space, followed by a novel technique that learns them. Our empirical evaluations across various evasion attacks indicate effective detection of AEs using learned domain constraints, with an average of 89.6%. Furthermore, extensive experiments on different Android malware detectors demonstrate that utilizing our learned domain constraints in Adversarial Training (AT) outperforms other AT-based defenses that rely on norm-bounded AEs or state-of-the-art non-uniform perturbations. Finally, we show that retraining a malware detector with a wide variety of feature-space realizable AEs results in a 77.9% robustness improvement against realizable AEs generated by unknown problem-space transformations, with up to 70x faster training than using problem-space realizable AEs.

													Machine learning (ML) has demonstrated significant advancements in Android malware detection (AMD); however, the resilience of ML against realistic evasion attacks remains a major obstacle for AMD. One of the primary factors contributing to this challenge is the scarcity of reliable generalizations. Malware classifiers with limited generalizability tend to overfit spurious correlations derived from biased features. Consequently, adversarial examples (AEs), generated by evasion attacks, can modify these features to evade detection. In this study, we propose a domain adaptation technique to improve the generalizability of AMD by aligning the distribution of malware samples and AEs. Specifically, we utilize meaningful feature dependencies, reflecting domain constraints in the feature space, to establish a robust feature space. Training on the proposed robust feature space enables malware classifiers to learn from predefined patterns associated with app functionality rather than from individual features. This approach helps mitigate spurious correlations inherent in the initial feature space. Our experiments conducted on DREBIN, a renowned Android malware detector, demonstrate that our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art defense, Sec-SVM, when facing realistic evasion attacks. In particular, our defense can improve adversarial robustness by up to 55% against realistic evasion attacks compared to Sec-SVM.

													Over the last decade, researchers have extensively explored the vulnerabilities of Android malware detectors to adversarial examples through the development of evasion attacks; however, the practicality of these attacks in real-world scenarios remains arguable. The majority of studies have assumed attackers know the details of the target classifiers used for malware detection, while in reality, malicious actors have limited access to the target classifiers. This paper introduces EvadeDroid, a problem-space adversarial attack designed to effectively evade black-box Android malware detectors in real-world scenarios. EvadeDroid constructs a collection of problem-space transformations derived from benign donors that share opcode-level similarity with malware apps by leveraging an n-gram-based approach. These transformations are then used to morph malware instances into benign ones via an iterative and incremental manipulation strategy. The proposed manipulation technique is a query-efficient optimization algorithm that can find and inject optimal sequences of transformations into malware apps. Our empirical evaluations, carried out on 1K malware apps, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating real-world adversarial examples in both soft- and hard-label settings. Our findings reveal that EvadeDroid can effectively deceive diverse malware detectors that utilize different features with various feature types. Specifically, EvadeDroid achieves evasion rates of 80%–95% against DREBIN, Sec-SVM, ADE-MA, MaMaDroid, and Opcode-SVM with only 1–9 queries. Furthermore, we show that the proposed problem-space adversarial attack is able to preserve its stealthiness against five popular commercial antiviruses with an average of 79% evasion rate, thus demonstrating its feasibility in the real world.

													On the modern web, trackers and advertisers frequently construct and monetize users’ detailed behavioral profiles without consent. Despite various studies on web tracking mechanisms and advertisements, there has been no rigorous study focusing on websites targeted at children. To address this gap, we present a measurement of tracking and (targeted) advertising on websites directed at children. Motivated by the lack of a comprehensive list of child-directed (i.e., targeted at children) websites, we first build a multilingual classifier based on web page titles and descriptions. Applying this classifier to over two million pages from the Common Crawl dataset, we compile a list of two thousand child-directed websites. Crawling these sites from five vantage points, we measure the prevalence of trackers, fingerprinting scripts, and advertisements. Our crawler detects ads displayed on child-directed websites and determines if ad targeting is enabled by scraping ad disclosure pages whenever available. Our results show that around 90% of child-directed websites embed one or more trackers, and about 27% contain targeted advertisements—a practice that should require verifiable parental consent. Next, we identify improper ads on child-directed websites by developing an ML pipeline that processes both images and text extracted from ads. The pipeline allows us to run semantic similarity queries for arbitrary search terms, revealing ads that promote services related to dating, weight loss, and mental health, as well as ads for sex toys and flirting chat services. Some of these ads feature repulsive, sexually-explicit and highly-inappropriate imagery. In summary, our findings indicate a trend of non-compliance with privacy regulations and troubling ad safety practices among many advertisers and child-directed websites. To ensure the protection of children and create a safer online environment, regulators and stakeholders must adopt and enforce more stringent measures.

                                                        Optimum-path forest (OPF) is one of the efficient graph-based frameworks that can determine the patterns of input dataset by extracting the optimal partitions of graph obtained through encoding data into a graph. Since OPF was introduced based on simple assumptions without considering the requirements of large-scale problems, this machine learning is an effective algorithm only for a reasonable size of input datasets. To provide a scalable OPF, this study introduces a strong coreset for accelerating OPF algorithm. Applying this approach can expedite OPF procedure, especially when it is working on massive datasets. Accordingly, a novel algebra is developed to represent the problem of OPF as an optimization problem for the proposed coreset definition. A novel coreset construction algorithm that can approximate the OPF solutions is subsequently proposed in order to improve the OPF construction speed. The simulation results of diverse experiments on various benchmark datasets illustrate computation gain and superiority of the proposed algorithm in terms of the construction and classification speeds as compared to the original algorithm while displaying reliably accurate performance. The presented coreset construction algorithm performs the training and testing phases of OPF up to 6.1 and 4.9 times faster than before, respectively.

                                                    Internet of Things (IoT) is a novel paradigm in computer networks in which resource-constrained
                                                    objects connect to unreliable Internet by using a wide range of technologies. The insecure nature of
                                                    the Internet and wireless sensor networks, that are the main components of IoT, make IoT vulnerable to
                                                    different attacks, especially routing attacks (as insider attacks). A novel real-time hybrid intrusion
                                                    detection framework is proposed in this study that consists of anomaly-based and specification-based
                                                    intrusion detection modules for detecting two well-known routing attacks in IoT called sinkhole and
                                                    selective-forwarding attacks. For this purpose, the specification-based intrusion detection agents,
                                                    that are located in the router nodes, analyze the behavior of their host nodes and send their local
                                                    results to the root node through normal data packets. In addition, an anomaly-based intrusion detection
                                                    agent, that is located in the root node, employs the unsupervised optimum-path forest algorithm for
                                                    projecting clustering models by using incoming data packets. This agent, which is based on the MapReduce
                                                    architecture, can work in a distributed platform for projecting clustering models and consequently parallel
                                                    detecting of anomalies as a global detection approach. The proposed method makes decision about suspicious
                                                    behavior by using a voting mechanism. Notably, the proposed method is also extended to detect wormhole
                                                    attack. The deployment of the hybrid proposed model is investigated in a smart-city scenario by an existing
                                                    platform, as well. The free network's scale and the ability to identify malicious nodes are two key features
                                                    of the proposed framework that are evaluated through different experiments in this study. The experimental
                                                    results of simulated scenarios showed that the proposed hybrid method can achieve true positive rate
                                                    of 76.19% and false positive rate of 5.92% when both sinkhole and selective-forwarding attacks were
                                                    launched simultaneously. These rates in detecting wormhole attack are 96.02% and 2.08%, respectively.

                                                    Optimum-path forest (OPF) is a graph-based machine learning method that can overcome some limitations of
                                                    the traditional machine learning algorithms that have been used in intrusion detection systems. This paper
                                                    presents a novel approach for intrusion detection using a modified OPF (MOPF) algorithm for improving the
                                                    performance of traditional OPF in terms of detection rate (DR), false alarm rate (FAR), and time of execution.
                                                    To address the problem of scalability in large datasets and also for achieving high attack recognition rates,
                                                    the proposed framework employs the k-means clustering algorithm, as a partitioning module, for generating
                                                    different homogeneous training subsets from original heterogeneous training samples. In the proposed MOPF
                                                    algorithm, the distance between unlabeled samples and the root (prototype) of every sample in OPF is also
                                                    considered in classifying unlabeled samples with the aim of improving the accuracy rate of traditional OPF
                                                    algorithm. Moreover, the centrality and the prestige concepts in the social network analysis are employed in
                                                    a pruning module for determining the most informative samples in training subsets to speed up the traditional
                                                    OPF algorithm. The experimental results on NSL-KDD dataset show that the proposed method performs better than
                                                    traditional OPF in terms of accuracy rate, DR, FAR, and cost per example (CPE) evaluation metrics.

                                                    Internet of things (IoT) is a novel emerging approach in computer networks wherein all heterogeneous objects
                                                    around us, which usually are resource-constrained objects, can connect to each other and also the Internet by
                                                    using a broad range of technologies. IoT is a hybrid network which includes the Internet and also wireless sensor
                                                    networks (WSNs) as the main components of IoT; so, implementing security mechanisms in IoT seems necessary.
                                                    This paper introduces a novel intrusion detection architecture model for IoT that provides the possibility of
                                                    distributed detection. The proposed hybrid model uses anomaly and misuse intrusion detection agents based on
                                                    the supervised and unsupervised optimum-path forest models for providing the ability to detect internal and
                                                    externals attacks, simultaneously. The number of input features to the proposed classifier is reduced by a hybrid
                                                    feature selection algorithm, as well. The experimental results of simulated scenarios show the superior

                                                    Today, detecting anomalous traffic and preventing it in computer networks has become increasingly
                                                    important for the community of security researchers. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is an effective
                                                    tool for reaching high security. This is a software tool for analyzing system behavior or network traffic as
                                                    input data to detect deviations from normal behavior. With the development of computer networks, highdimensional
                                                    input data analysis has become a huge problem in IDSs. One solution for overcoming this
                                                    problem is feature selection, which is a process for selecting an optimal subset of features. Populationbased
                                                    heuristic search algorithms have been widely used for this optimization problem. This entry presents
                                                    a novel feature selection method based on a binary gravitational search algorithm (BGSA). The proposed
                                                    method, which is called modified BGSA (MBGSA), uses BGSA for performing the global search to find
                                                    the best subset of features through the wrapper method. Moreover, for improving the efficiency of BGSA,
                                                    mutual information (MI) feature selector under the uniform information distribution (MIFS-U) method,
                                                    which works as a filter method, is integrated into BGSA as the inner optimization layer. In fact, with the
                                                    computation of the relevance between each selected feature and the target class and the redundancy between
                                                    the selected features (in the feature subset generated by the wrapper), MIFS-U will find more valuable
                                                    features that have maximum relevance to the target class and minimum redundancy to each other. The
                                                    experimental results on NSL-KDD dataset using different classifiers show that the proposed method can
                                                    find better subset features and achieve higher accuracy and an improved detection rate using fewer features
                                                    as compared to standard BGSA and binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) feature selection methods.

                                                    Optimum-path forest (OPF) is a novel supervised graph-based classifier which reduces the
                                                    classification problem into partitioning of vertices in a graph derived from the data samples.
                                                    One of the main processes in OPF is identifying the optimum set of key samples named prototypes.
                                                    This process is based on creating a minimum spanning tree on a complete weighted graph which is
                                                    derived from the training samples; hence, it is much time-consuming for large-scale problems.
                                                    In this study, for overcoming this limitation, the process of finding the prototypes in
                                                    traditional OPF is modified by using Markov cluster (MCL) algorithm. The graph partitioning
                                                    in MCL is based on finding key samples named attractors, which attract other related samples;
                                                    so the obtained attractors can be selected as prototypes for generating optimum-path trees.
                                                    Experiments on public benchmark datasets show that the speed of proposed modified OPF is
                                                    improved considerably as compared to the traditional OPF.

                                                    In computer networks, Internet of things (IoT) is an emerging paradigm wherein smart and resource-constrained
                                                    objects can connect to Internet by using a wide range of technologies. Due to the insecure nature of
                                                    Internet and also wireless sensor networks (WSNs), which are the main components of IoT, implementing security
                                                    mechanisms in IoT seems necessary. To deal with intrusions which may occur in IoT, a novel intrusion detection
                                                    architecture model for IoT is proposed in this paper. This model is based on MapReduce approach with the aim of
                                                    distributed detection. To provide multi-faceted detection (from the Internet and WSNs sides), the proposed model
                                                    consists of anomaly-based and misuse-based intrusion detection agents that use supervised and unsupervised
                                                    optimum-path forest model for intrusion detection. The experimental results of simulated scenarios show the
                                                    superior performance of proposed method in intrusion detection for IoT.

                                                    Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) play an important role in the security of computer
                                                    networks. One of the main challenges in IDSs is the high-dimensional input data analysis.
                                                    Feature selection is a solution to overcoming this problem. This paper presents a hybrid
                                                    feature selection method using binary gravitational search algorithm (BGSA) and mutual
                                                    information (MI) for improving the efficiency of standard BGSA as a feature selection algorithm.
                                                    The proposed method, called MI-BGSA, used BGSA as a wrapper-based feature selection method for
                                                    performing global search. Moreover, MI approach was integrated into the BGSA, as a filter-based
                                                    method, to compute the feature–feature and the feature–class mutual information with the aim of
                                                    pruning the subset of features. This strategy found the features considering the least
                                                    redundancy to the selected features and also the most relevance to the target class.
                                                    A two-objective function based on maximizing the detection rate and minimizing the false
                                                    positive rate was defined as a fitness function to control the search direction of the
                                                    standard BGSA. The experimental results on the NSL-KDD dataset showed that the proposed
                                                    method can reduce the feature space dramatically. Moreover, the proposed algorithm found
                                                    better subset of features and achieved higher accuracy and detection rate as compared to
                                                    the some standard wrapper-based and filter-based feature selection methods.
