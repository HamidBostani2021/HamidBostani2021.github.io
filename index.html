                                        My primary research interest is investigating AI in systems security because I strongly feel that AI is a promising problem solver that can obtain satisfying solutions for complex problems. Indeed, the main area of my research is at the intersection of machine learning and systems security by concentrating on intrusion detection and malware analysis.
                                        <br />

                                        Previously, I was a Research Assistant at Islamic Azad University (IAU), South Tehran Branch who was working on AI, particularly scalable machine learning. My considerable background in AI began on my master's project while I was trying to present an AI-based intrusion detection system for IoT that could detect various security threats.
										During this time, I have succeeded to present several innovations in machine learning, IoT security, and feature selection that brought various honors and awards for me.
										<br/>
										<br/>
										From September 2012 till September 2020, I was working in the National Organization of Educational Testing, Tehran, Iran as a Full-Stack Developer. It was a useful industrial career that made me an experienced software developer.
										<br/>
										<br/>
										I received my BSc and MSc degrees in Computer Engineering from IAU, Shiraz and South Tehran Branches, Iran in 2008 and 2015, respectively.

                                                    Over the past decade, the digital life of most people has moved from stationary devices such as desktop computers to computationally powerful mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablets or smartwatches. Not only do these devices bring a new level of convenience for users, they are also much more vulnerable to attacks that compromise the confidentiality of users' private data - as revealed by whistleblower Edward Snowden's global surveillance disclosures.

                                                    One might think that similar attacks existed before, but mobile smart devices over many new attack vectors that are not known
                                                    from stationary desktop PCs. For example, a new class of attack vector results from the plethora of sensors these devices
                                                    carry, such as GPS and motion sensors. While some of these attacks can be thwarted by sensible use of
                                                    strong cryptography - for instance, there now exist secure text-messenger apps that allow users to encrypt their
                                                    communication - strong cryptography alone is not able to protect against attacks that exploit side channels.
                                                    Side channels allow the exploitation of information emanating from the physical device, such as
                                                    electromagnetic radiation and power consumption. We are investigating the different classes of
                                                    attacks on smart mobile devices through the analysis of hardware and software requirements and design
                                                    countermeasures using novel and creative ideas by studying the problem from different angles. Our findings will then
                                                    be applied to other problem areas such as the Internet of Things. I am working on this project as PhD Candidate in the <a href="https://www.ru.nl/dis/" target="_blank">Digital Security group</a>, Radboud University.

                                                    Over the past decades, machine learning as the most efficient tool for pattern recognition has been the subject of
                                                    many studies. Optimum-path forest (OPF) is an outstanding graph-based
                                                    machine learning method that reduces the pattern recognition problems into the partitioning of
                                                    the graphs derived from the input data sets. OPF as a natural multi-classifier is a fast,
                                                    simple, and parameter-independent machine that supports partial overlapping among the classes.
                                                    Howover, this machine is an effective machine learning algorithm just for a
                                                    reasonable size of the input data sets. It seems that keeping a small sketch (or synopsis) of
                                                    some data that contains an approximation of the original data can be a proper solution for the
                                                    high computational complexity of OPF over the massive data sets. Coreset is a special data summarization
                                                    method that can be used for holding the small sketch of massive data sets. Therefore, to cope with high
                                                    computational complexity of OPF over massive data sets, this project tries to use the idea of
                                                    coreset in the context of OPF to provide a scalable OPF. This work is supported in part by <a href="http://insf.org/en" target="_blank">Iran National Science Foundation</a> grant No. 96010151.

                                                    The Internet of Things (IoT) is a worldwide network including all identifiable heterogeneous objects around us
                                                    such as smartphones, laptops or smart sensors that can connect to the Internet by using a wide range of
                                                    technologies. IoT is able to provide accessibility to the Internet for all physical objects since it is a
                                                    hybrid network of the Internet and diverse networks with heterogeneous nodes. Generally, due to the insecure
                                                    nature of the Internet as well as Wireless Sensor Networks, which are the main components of IoT, implementing
                                                    security mechanisms in IoT seems necessary. To deal with intrusions that may occur in IoT, a novel multi-faceted
                                                    intrusion detection system is proposed in this thesis which can detect both cyber-attacks and insider-attacks

Furthermore, the MOPF-based IDS is improved in the last section as a contribution by using an outperformed clustering algorithm.

                                                        Optimum-path forest (OPF) is one of the efficient graph-based frameworks that can determine the patterns of input dataset by extracting the optimal partitions of graph obtained through encoding data into a graph. Since OPF was introduced based on simple assumptions without considering the requirements of large-scale problems, this machine learning is an effective algorithm only for a reasonable size of input datasets. To provide a scalable OPF, this study introduces a strong coreset for accelerating OPF algorithm. Applying this approach can expedite OPF procedure, especially when it is working on massive datasets. Accordingly, a novel algebra is developed to represent the problem of OPF as an optimization problem for the proposed coreset definition. A novel coreset construction algorithm that can approximate the OPF solutions is subsequently proposed in order to improve the OPF construction speed. The simulation results of diverse experiments on various benchmark datasets illustrate computation gain and superiority of the proposed algorithm in terms of the construction and classification speeds as compared to the original algorithm while displaying reliably accurate performance. The presented coreset construction algorithm performs the training and testing phases of OPF up to 6.1 and 4.9 times faster than before, respectively.

                                                    corresponding derived graphs has a major effect on the speed of OPF. In this study a novel version of
                                                    OPF is introduced which utilizes coreset approach for reducing the scale of the input dataset. From the
                                                    aspect of the computational geometry, coreset is a small set of points that includes the best representative

                                                    Internet of Things (IoT) is a novel paradigm in computer networks in which resource-constrained
                                                    objects connect to unreliable Internet by using a wide range of technologies. The insecure nature of
                                                    the Internet and wireless sensor networks, that are the main components of IoT, make IoT vulnerable to
                                                    different attacks, especially routing attacks (as insider attacks). A novel real-time hybrid intrusion
                                                    detection framework is proposed in this study that consists of anomaly-based and specification-based
                                                    intrusion detection modules for detecting two well-known routing attacks in IoT called sinkhole and
                                                    selective-forwarding attacks. For this purpose, the specification-based intrusion detection agents,
                                                    that are located in the router nodes, analyze the behavior of their host nodes and send their local
                                                    results to the root node through normal data packets. In addition, an anomaly-based intrusion detection
                                                    agent, that is located in the root node, employs the unsupervised optimum-path forest algorithm for
                                                    projecting clustering models by using incoming data packets. This agent, which is based on the MapReduce
                                                    architecture, can work in a distributed platform for projecting clustering models and consequently parallel
                                                    detecting of anomalies as a global detection approach. The proposed method makes decision about suspicious
                                                    behavior by using a voting mechanism. Notably, the proposed method is also extended to detect wormhole
                                                    attack. The deployment of the hybrid proposed model is investigated in a smart-city scenario by an existing
                                                    platform, as well. The free network's scale and the ability to identify malicious nodes are two key features
                                                    of the proposed framework that are evaluated through different experiments in this study. The experimental
                                                    results of simulated scenarios showed that the proposed hybrid method can achieve true positive rate
                                                    of 76.19% and false positive rate of 5.92% when both sinkhole and selective-forwarding attacks were
                                                    launched simultaneously. These rates in detecting wormhole attack are 96.02% and 2.08%, respectively.

                                                    Optimum-path forest (OPF) is a graph-based machine learning method that can overcome some limitations of
                                                    the traditional machine learning algorithms that have been used in intrusion detection systems. This paper
                                                    presents a novel approach for intrusion detection using a modified OPF (MOPF) algorithm for improving the
                                                    performance of traditional OPF in terms of detection rate (DR), false alarm rate (FAR), and time of execution.
                                                    To address the problem of scalability in large datasets and also for achieving high attack recognition rates,
                                                    the proposed framework employs the k-means clustering algorithm, as a partitioning module, for generating
                                                    different homogeneous training subsets from original heterogeneous training samples. In the proposed MOPF
                                                    algorithm, the distance between unlabeled samples and the root (prototype) of every sample in OPF is also
                                                    considered in classifying unlabeled samples with the aim of improving the accuracy rate of traditional OPF
                                                    algorithm. Moreover, the centrality and the prestige concepts in the social network analysis are employed in
                                                    a pruning module for determining the most informative samples in training subsets to speed up the traditional
                                                    OPF algorithm. The experimental results on NSL-KDD dataset show that the proposed method performs better than
                                                    traditional OPF in terms of accuracy rate, DR, FAR, and cost per example (CPE) evaluation metrics.

                                                    around us, which usually are resource-constrained objects, can connect to each other and also the Internet by
                                                    using a broad range of technologies. IoT is a hybrid network which includes the Internet and also wireless sensor
                                                    networks (WSNs) as the main components of IoT; so, implementing security mechanisms in IoT seems necessary.
                                                    This paper introduces a novel intrusion detection architecture model for IoT that provides the possibility of
                                                    distributed detection. The proposed hybrid model uses anomaly and misuse intrusion detection agents based on
                                                    the supervised and unsupervised optimum-path forest models for providing the ability to detect internal and
                                                    externals attacks, simultaneously. The number of input features to the proposed classifier is reduced by a hybrid
                                                    feature selection algorithm, as well. The experimental results of simulated scenarios show the superior
                                                    performance of proposed security mechanism in multi-faceted detection.

                                                    Today, detecting anomalous traffic and preventing it in computer networks has become increasingly
                                                    important for the community of security researchers. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is an effective
                                                    tool for reaching high security. This is a software tool for analyzing system behavior or network traffic as
                                                    input data to detect deviations from normal behavior. With the development of computer networks, highdimensional
                                                    input data analysis has become a huge problem in IDSs. One solution for overcoming this
                                                    problem is feature selection, which is a process for selecting an optimal subset of features. Populationbased
                                                    heuristic search algorithms have been widely used for this optimization problem. This entry presents
                                                    a novel feature selection method based on a binary gravitational search algorithm (BGSA). The proposed
                                                    method, which is called modified BGSA (MBGSA), uses BGSA for performing the global search to find
                                                    the best subset of features through the wrapper method. Moreover, for improving the efficiency of BGSA,
                                                    mutual information (MI) feature selector under the uniform information distribution (MIFS-U) method,
                                                    which works as a filter method, is integrated into BGSA as the inner optimization layer. In fact, with the
                                                    computation of the relevance between each selected feature and the target class and the redundancy between
                                                    the selected features (in the feature subset generated by the wrapper), MIFS-U will find more valuable
                                                    features that have maximum relevance to the target class and minimum redundancy to each other. The
                                                    experimental results on NSL-KDD dataset using different classifiers show that the proposed method can
                                                    find better subset features and achieve higher accuracy and an improved detection rate using fewer features
                                                    as compared to standard BGSA and binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) feature selection methods.

                                                    Optimum-path forest (OPF) is a novel supervised graph-based classifier which reduces the
                                                    classification problem into partitioning of vertices in a graph derived from the data samples.
                                                    One of the main processes in OPF is identifying the optimum set of key samples named prototypes.
                                                    This process is based on creating a minimum spanning tree on a complete weighted graph which is
                                                    derived from the training samples; hence, it is much time-consuming for large-scale problems.
                                                    In this study, for overcoming this limitation, the process of finding the prototypes in
                                                    traditional OPF is modified by using Markov cluster (MCL) algorithm. The graph partitioning
                                                    in MCL is based on finding key samples named attractors, which attract other related samples;
                                                    so the obtained attractors can be selected as prototypes for generating optimum-path trees.
                                                    Experiments on public benchmark datasets show that the speed of proposed modified OPF is
                                                    improved considerably as compared to the traditional OPF.

                                                    In computer networks, Internet of things (IoT) is an emerging paradigm wherein smart and resource-constrained
                                                    objects can connect to Internet by using a wide range of technologies. Due to the insecure nature of

                                                    Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) play an important role in the security of computer
                                                    networks. One of the main challenges in IDSs is the high-dimensional input data analysis.
                                                    Feature selection is a solution to overcoming this problem. This paper presents a hybrid
                                                    feature selection method using binary gravitational search algorithm (BGSA) and mutual
                                                    information (MI) for improving the efficiency of standard BGSA as a feature selection algorithm.
                                                    The proposed method, called MI-BGSA, used BGSA as a wrapper-based feature selection method for
                                                    performing global search. Moreover, MI approach was integrated into the BGSA, as a filter-based
                                                    method, to compute the feature–feature and the feature–class mutual information with the aim of
                                                    pruning the subset of features. This strategy found the features considering the least
                                                    redundancy to the selected features and also the most relevance to the target class.
                                                    A two-objective function based on maximizing the detection rate and minimizing the false
                                                    positive rate was defined as a fitness function to control the search direction of the
                                                    standard BGSA. The experimental results on the NSL-KDD dataset showed that the proposed
                                                    method can reduce the feature space dramatically. Moreover, the proposed algorithm found
                                                    better subset of features and achieved higher accuracy and detection rate as compared to
                                                    the some standard wrapper-based and filter-based feature selection methods.
